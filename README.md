# vegan-cookbook
This little project aims to store vegan recipes in NoSQL database and enable the user to search for specific recipes using ingredients list. 

Most of the technologies used here are new to me - I created this project to learn new frameworks and technologies using real-life application.

Tech stack:
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- MongoDB
- ReactJS

Soon I'll add tasks to be achieved here, at the moment it's just a small, after-hours project.
